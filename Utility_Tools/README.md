## Utility Tools

This folder contains simple and practical Python programs that simulate useful everyday tools like timers and cart calculators.

### Programs Included:
- countdown_timer.py: Takes seconds as input and displays a real-time countdown in HH:MM:SS format.
- shopping_cart.py: Allows users to add items and prices to a cart and calculates the total.
- menu_order.py: Displays a fixed menu with prices, takes selected items, and calculates the total bill.

### Concepts Covered:
- Loops (for, while True)
- Lists and dictionaries
- String formatting (f-strings, :.2f, :02)
- Input validation and conditions
- Time manipulation (time.sleep())

These programs are part of my Python relearning journey to build practical tools while revisiting key language fundamentals.
