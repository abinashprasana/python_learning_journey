# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I relearn Python in preparation for my Master's in Artificial Intelligence. It includes beginner-level programs that cover foundational programming concepts through simple, practical examples.

Each folder contains grouped programs by theme, complete with individual README.md files for context and explanations.
