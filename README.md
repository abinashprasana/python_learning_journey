# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I brush up on Python in preparation for my Master's in Artificial Intelligence.  
Each program focuses on practical problem-solving using core programming constructs, structured by project type and concept.

- **Hangman Game** 🎯 – ASCII-art guessing game
- **Potion Mixing Game** 🧪 – Uses exception handling for game logic
- **Simple Snake Game** 🐍 – Classic snake using pygame (movement, food, collision)

### 🔐 [Encryption_Projects](./Encryption_Projects)
Basic cryptography tool:
- **Python Encryption Program** 🔒 – Substitution cipher to encrypt/decrypt text

### 🧾 [Banking_Program](./Banking_Program)
Python CLI programs for simulating banking operations.
- **Banking Program** 💰 – Deposit, withdraw, check balance
- **Bank Account Management System** 🏦 – Uses classmethod, staticmethod

### 👨‍🏫 [OOP_Concepts](./OOP_Concepts)
Programs demonstrating object-oriented concepts in Python.
- **Smart School System** 🏫 – Inheritance types (single, multilevel, multiple, hybrid)
- **Payment Gateway** 💳 – Abstract base classes
- **Student Management** 🎓 – Property decorators
- **Library Management** 📚 – Magic method overloading

### ⚙ [Logger_and_Timer_Decorator](./Logger_and_Timer_Decorator)
- **log_timer_decorator.py** 📝 – Decorator that logs and times function execution

### 🔗 [API_Projects](./API_Projects)
API-based data interaction in Python.
- **Pokémon Info Explorer** 🧩 – Uses PokeAPI to show Pokémon info (types, abilities)

## ✅ Skills & Concepts Covered
- Loops, conditionals, input/output
- Lists, dictionaries, sets, string formatting
- Modular programming with `def`
- OOP (classes, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation)
- Decorators and multithreading
- Error handling and exception flow
- Working with APIs and third-party modules (e.g. pygame, requests)
