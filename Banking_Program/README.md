# 🏦 Bank Programming

This folder contains beginner-friendly terminal-based Python banking programs built as part of my learning journey. These scripts simulate basic banking operations like checking balances, making deposits and withdrawals, and tracking multiple accounts.

## 🧾 Programs Included:

### 1️⃣ **Banking Program**
A simple terminal simulation where you can:
- Check your balance

### 2️⃣ **Bank Account Management System**
A class-based program that demonstrates:
- Object instantiation for account holders
- Class methods and static methods
- Instance-level deposits and total account tracking

### 🧠 Features:
- `@staticmethod` to show bank policy
- `@classmethod` for tracking total accounts created
- OOP structure with constructor, instance, and class-level behavior

### ▶️ Sample Output:
```bash
Bank Policy: Minimum balance must be $500. Withdrawal limit: $25,0000/day
Abby deposited ₹10000. New balance: ₹510000
Lcuy deposited ₹10000. New balance: ₹10500
Total accounts created: 2
```
