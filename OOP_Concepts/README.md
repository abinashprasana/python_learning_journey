# 🧠 OOP Concepts

This folder contains Python programs focused on practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
Each script demonstrates core OOP concepts like inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, magic methods, and more — through real-world inspired simulations.

## 📦 Programs Included

### 1️⃣ Python Smart School System  
📁 `Python_Smart_School_System/main.py`  
Demonstrates:
- ✅ Single Inheritance
- ✅ Multilevel Inheritance
- ✅ Multiple Inheritance
- ✅ Hierarchical Inheritance
- ✅ Hybrid Inheritance  
👨‍🏫 Simulates various roles like Student, Teacher, Admin, Librarian, etc.

### 2️⃣ Python Payment Gateway  
📁 `Python_Payment_Gateway/main.py`  
Concepts Used:
- ✅ Abstract Base Class (ABC)
- ✅ Polymorphism  
💳 Simulates a basic payment interface with Credit Card, PayPal, and UPI methods.

---

### 3️⃣ Python Bank Account Management System  
📁 `Python_Bank_Account_Management_System/main.py`  
Covers:
- ✅ Class variables
- ✅ Instance methods
- ✅ Static methods
- ✅ Class methods  
🏦 A simulation of opening accounts, deposits, and bank policy awareness.

---

### 4️⃣ Python Library Management with Magic Method  
📁 `Python_Library_Management_with_Magic_Method/main.py`  
Magic Methods Used:
- ✅ `__init__`, `__str__`, `__len__`, `__eq__`, `__add__`  
📚 Creates fantasy book objects and allows comparison, combination, and introspection of book data.

---

### 5️⃣ Python Managing a Student with @property  
📁 `Python_Managing_a_Student_with_Property/main.py`  
Demonstrates:
- ✅ Encapsulation
- ✅ Use of `@property` and setter methods  
🎓 Manages grade validation logic using property decorators.

---

## ✅ Key Concepts Practiced
- Class and Object Structure
- Types of Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, etc.)
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Encapsulation using `@property`
- Static vs Class vs Instance Methods
- Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__eq__`, `__add__`, etc.)
